# <a name="running-cutlang"></a> Running CutLang

CutLang is run anywhere using the `CLA` (shell script) or using the `CLA.py` scripts

```bash
 CLA (or CLA.py) [inputrootfile] [inputeventformat] -i [adlfilename.adl] -e [numberofevents]
 # Also, you can start simultaneous processes, which can increase the analysis speed tremendously.
 CLA (or CLA.py) [inputrootfile] [inputeventformat] -i [adlfilename.adl] -e [numberofevents] -j 0
 # When you enter 0 in the j flag, it will start the process as much as the number of processor cores, if you want, you can set the number of processes by changing the value from 0.
 # for example:
 # CLA (or CLA.py) [inputrootfile] [inputeventformat] -i [adlfilename.adl] -e [numberofevents] -j 8
 # above command starts 8 simultaneous processes
```
- Input event formats can be: *DELPHES, CMSNANO, LHCO, FCC, ATLASVLL, ATLASOD, CMSOD, VLLBG3 and LVL0 (CutLang internal format)* 
- Number of events is optional.

The output will be saved in `histoOut-[adlfilename].root`.  This ROOT file will have a separate directory for each search region, which contains the relevant histograms and ADL content defining the region. The histogram(s) `cutflow` (and `bincounts`, in case search bins are specified in the region) exist by default.
